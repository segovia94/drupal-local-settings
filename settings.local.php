 * @code

 * will allow the site to only run from www.example.com.
 *
 * If you are running multisite, or if you are running your site from
 * different domain names (eg, you don't redirect http://www.example.com to
 * http://example.com), you should specify all of the host patterns that are
 * allowed by your site.
 *
 * For example:
 * @code
 * $settings['trusted_host_patterns'] = array(
 *   '^example\.com$',
 *   '^.+\.example\.com$',
 *   '^example\.org$',
 *   '^.+\.example\.org$',
